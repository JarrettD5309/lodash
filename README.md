## Description
This is a project from Codecademy in which the user creates object methods to mimic methods found in the Lodash Library. For each method the instructions give an overview of what the method should accomplish and then a walk-through of the thought process Codecademy suggests to complete the method. Initially I solved each of the methods without referencing the suggested walk-through. After that I went back and solved the methods using the walk-through. The `_.js` file includes both sets of solutions.
